# Sell Page Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Sell page is a **protected, multi-step form** that allows authenticated users to list their properties for sale or rent on the platform. It includes authentication protection, user type selection, and comprehensive property listing capabilities.

---

## üîê Authentication Protection

### ProtectedRoute Component
Located at: `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`

**Features:**
- Checks if user is authenticated via `localStorage.getItem('isAuthenticated')`
- Shows a beautiful authentication required page if not logged in
- Redirects user back to the intended page after login/signup
- Includes Login and Sign Up buttons with redirect parameters

**How it works:**
```tsx
<ProtectedRoute>
  <Sell />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

**Authentication Check:**
```javascript
const isAuthenticated = localStorage.getItem('isAuthenticated') === 'true';
```

**Redirect Flow:**
1. User tries to access `/sell`
2. If not authenticated, sees auth required message
3. Clicks Login/Signup with redirect param: `/login?redirect=/sell`
4. After successful login, redirected back to `/sell`

## üí° Key Decisions & Architecture

### Why localStorage for auth?
- **Temporary solution** for prototype/MVP
- Should be replaced with HttpOnly cookies + JWT
- Easy to implement for demonstration

### Why multi-step form?
- **Better UX** - breaks complex form into digestible chunks
- **Progressive disclosure** - only show relevant fields
- **Higher conversion** - users less overwhelmed
- **Clear progress** - users know how far they are

### Why account type selection?
- **Professional platform** - distinguishes owners from agents
- **Trust building** - verifies agent credentials
- **Better matching** - buyers can filter by direct owner
- **Compliance** - meets real estate licensing requirements
