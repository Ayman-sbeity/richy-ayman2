## 🎯 Plan Filtering Logic

### Dynamic Plan Display
Plans are filtered based on the user's selected account type in **Step 0**:

```typescript
// Owner sees:
- Free Plan
- Basic Plan
- Professional Plan

// Realtor sees:
- Basic Plan
- Professional Plan
- Agency Plan
```

### Implementation
```typescript
export const getPlansByUserType = (userType: 'owner' | 'realtor') => {
  return subscriptionPlans.filter(
    plan => plan.userType === userType || plan.userType === 'both'
  );
};
```

---

## 💰 Billing Cycles & Savings

### Monthly vs Yearly Toggle
Users can switch between billing cycles using a toggle button:
- **Monthly:** Pay month-to-month, cancel anytime
- **Yearly:** Pay once yearly, get significant discounts

### Savings Calculation
```typescript
Basic Plan:
- Monthly: $15/month × 12 = $180/year
- Yearly: $150/year
- **Save: $30/year (16.7% discount)**

Professional Plan:
- Monthly: $45/month × 12 = $540/year
- Yearly: $450/year
- **Save: $90/year (16.7% discount)**

Agency Plan:
- Monthly: $99/month × 12 = $1,188/year
- Yearly: $990/year
- **Save: $198/year (16.7% discount)**
```

### Visual Indicators
- Green "Save up to 20%" badge on Yearly toggle button

## 💡 Business Logic & Best Practices

### Notification System
The **Free Plan** for owners includes:
- Email notifications for new inquiries
- Basic property listing
- Limited to 1 property at a time

This creates a **freemium model** that encourages upgrades while providing value.

### Upgrade Path
```
Free (Owner) → Basic ($15/mo) → Professional ($45/mo)
                                      ↓
                              Agency ($99/mo) [Realtor only]
```

### Pricing Psychology
1. **Anchor Pricing:** Free plan makes $15 seem very affordable
2. **Most Popular Badge:** Guides users to Professional plan (highest margin)
3. **Yearly Savings:** Encourages annual commitment (better retention)
4. **Feature Comparison:** Clear value progression between tiers
