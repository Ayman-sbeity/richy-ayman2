## 🎯 Key URLs to Test

- **Beirut Properties**: `http://localhost:3000/listings?city=beirut`

## 🐛 Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Map Placeholder**: Location map shows placeholder (ready for Google Maps integration)
2. **Sample Data**: Using 8 hardcoded properties (ready for backend API)
3. **Form Submission**: Shows alert message (ready for email/API integration)
4. **Agent Info**: Static data (ready for agent management system)
